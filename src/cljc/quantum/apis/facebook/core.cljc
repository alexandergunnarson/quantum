; Rate limitations
; https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/api-rate-limiting
; Quora:
; After some testing and discussion with the Facebook platform team,
; there is no official limit I'm aware of or can find in the documentation.
; However, I've found 600 calls per 600 seconds, per token & per IP to be
; about where they stop you. I've also seen some application based rate
; limiting but don't have any numbers.
