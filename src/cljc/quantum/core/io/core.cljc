(defn assoc!

   It's recommended not to use js/localStorage, IndexedDB, or the Filesystem API

   1) Any authentication your application requires can be bypassed by a

   2) A single Cross Site Scripting can be used to steal all the data

   3) A single Cross Site Scripting can be used to load malicious data
