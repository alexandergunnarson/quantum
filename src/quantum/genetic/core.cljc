  "Genetic algorithms.
   A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search heuristic that mimics the process
   of natural evolution. This heuristic is routinely used to generate useful
   solutions to optimization and search problems. Genetic algorithms belong
   to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA), which generate
   solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural
   evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover.

   A typical genetic algorithm requires:
   - a genetic representation of the solution domain
   - a fitness function to evaluate the solution domain")
