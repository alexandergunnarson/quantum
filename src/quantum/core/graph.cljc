; TO EXPLORE
; - Mathematica
;   - Tools for visualizing and analysing directed and undirected graphs
; ============================================

; Ubergraph goes beyond Loom's protocols, allowing a
; mixture of directed and undirected edges within a
; single graph, multiple "parallel" edges between a
; given pair of nodes, multiple weights per edge,
; and changeable weights.
; Ubergraph is a great choice for people who want to
; use Loom, but don't want to think about which specific
; Loom graph implementation to use. (Hmmm, do I need
; directed edges or undirected edges? Do I need weights
; or attributes for this project? I'm not sure yet,
; so I'll just use ubergraph because it can do it all!
