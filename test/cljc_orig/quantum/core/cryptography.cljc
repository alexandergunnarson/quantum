; ===== DIGEST =====

#?(:clj
(defn ^bytes digest
  "Creates a byte digest of the string @s according to the @md-type algorithm.
   Assumes UTF-8 encoding for string passed.

   WARNINGS:
     CMU Software Engineering Institute now says that MD5
     'should be considered cryptographically broken and
      unsuitable for further use.'
     SHA-1 has some possible vulnerabilities too.
     Most U.S. government applications now require the SHA-2
     family of hash functions.

     As for SHA-3, attackers can crack SHA-3 hashed passswords 8 times
     faster than SHA-2 hashed passwords -
     2 times faster because we need to halve the number of hash iterations
     and 4 times faster because of SHA-3 hardware being faster than SHA-2 hardware.

     SHA-3, like SHA-2, is not intended for use as a password hash function.

     Don't encrypt passwords symmetrically. Other things, maybe, but not passwords.
     Anything that can be asymmetrically encrypted instead of symmetrically, do it."
