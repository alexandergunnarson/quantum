NOTE: There is a separate index for each vOlmne.

MAORI PERSONAL NAMES: References to other forms of one name have been given where
likely to give the user other possible leads, however it cannot be guaranteed that these are the
same persons. It is necessary to search the index well, as names have been interpreted
sometimes in several spellings. It is also essential to keep in mind the fact that Maori called
themselves by different names. ‘ I

The fullest Maori name is used as the reference, although all variations are entered. Maori are
indexed by first name, for example: ‘

TEONE KIHAU
