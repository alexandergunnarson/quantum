provides other terms and conditions along with any Supplementary Software.

Records Retention and Audit 
---------------------------

If Cognitect reasonably suspects the Software has been distributed to or obtained by any
person or party without Cognitect' prior written consent, that Software is being varied or
accessed or used independently of the Software or that Licensee is otherwise breaching a term of
this License, Licensee agrees Cognitect has the right to require the Licensee to provide a
qualified certificate executed by the Licensee's auditor verifying compliance with the terms of this
EULA. If such an unqualified certificate is not received by Cognitect within thirty (30)
calendar days of being required, it will be considered that a breach of this EULA has occurred
allowing Cognitect to terminate the licenses granted under this EULA.
